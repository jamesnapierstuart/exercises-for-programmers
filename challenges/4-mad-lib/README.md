# Mad Lib
Mad libs are a simple game where you create a story template with blanks for 
words. You, or another player, then construct a list of words and place them 
into the story, creating an often silly or funny story as a result.

Create a simple mad-lib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb, and 
an adjective and injects those into a story that you create.

### **Example Output**
>`Enter a noun:` 

[user inputs a noun]

>`Enter a verb:`

[user inputs a verb] 

>`Enter an adjective:`

[user inputs an adjective]

>`Enter an adverb:`

[user inputs an adverb]

>`Do you walk your blue dog quickly?`

### **Constraints**
- Use a single output statement for this program.
- If your language supports string interpolation or string substitution, use it 
to build up the output.

### **Challenges**
- Add more inputs to the program to expand the story.
- Implement a branching story, where the answers to questions determine how the 
story is constructed. Youâ€™ll explore this concept more in the problems in 
Chapter 4, Making Decisions, on page 29.
